# Extension of Mid‐Season Drainage in Paddy Rice Cultivation
#### *under the J-Credit Scheme's agricultural methodology*

## What is the J-Credit Scheme?
The J-Credit Scheme certifies and makes tradeable the difference between:

1. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions that would have occurred without any reduction activities (the baseline), and
2. The actual emissions after implementing reduction or absorption activities.

That difference, which is measured in tons of CO₂ equivalent, is issued as a credit. Credits can come from reduced emissions or from carbon absorption through activities.
